The aim of our project is to, first, predict the genre of a movie poster, then, produce a suitable soundtrack for the predicted genre. Because of this, our project has a machine learning pipeline. Our project will have two machine learning models. The first model will take a movie poster image as an input and the output of the model would be its predicted genre. This output will be the input of our second model which is for producing a soundtrack. Consequently, the predicted soundtrack depicts a prediction of movie posterâ€™s soundtrack according to its genre.
